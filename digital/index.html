This publishing method allowed content creators to create and promote their content through easily accessible online platforms such as social media, save up on production cost unlike traditional publishing, and easily modify and monitor their created content, and more <a class="citation" href="#kemp_what_2024">(Kemp, 2024)</a>.</p> <h2 id="a-look-into-e-book-history">A look into e-book history</h2> <p>Digital publishing was first recognized during the 1930s in the form of spoken audiobooks. These were devices that used recordings and audio which allowed people with disabilities to access content without the need for help in narration <a class="citation" href="#constantopedos_history_nodate">(Constantopedos, n.d.)</a>. While it is not actually digital, it definitely set the vision for digital publishing in the future.</p> <p>Then came 1971, the year in which Michael Hart founded <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><strong>Project Gutenberg</strong></a>, an online library that archives thousands of free published books that eventually revolutionized the use of e-books today. In the early 1990s, a rise in portable gadgets emerged including e-book readers such as the <em>Rocket eBook</em> (1998) and <em>Palm Pilot</em> (1996).</p> <p>Unfortunately, these devices soon fell flat as it wasn’t as widely used as a reading format and readers were facing technological limitations at the time, leading to a drop in e-books’ popularity <a class="citation" href="#taylor_very_nodate">(Taylor, n.d.)</a>. Digital publishing had gone through a pause during this period since technology was still too limited in terms of accessibility and features, plus not everyone had the ability to afford such devices thus making it quite expensive and highly inaccessible for some.</p> <p>Technological advancements bloomed in the 2000s as new innovative gadgets entered the market. Popular companies including Sony picked up on the idea of e-books and released their own portable device back in 2006 called <em>Sony Reader</em>.</p> <p>The state of digital publishing was slowly rising again but it was not until Amazon launched their own device called <em>Kindle</em> that e-books became widely known and used by the population <a class="citation" href="#taylor_very_nodate">(Taylor, n.d.)</a>. Since <em>Kindle</em>’s successful release in 2007, digital publishing only continues to grow in popularity.</p> <p>Now, publishing content and accessing popular e-book titles has never been easier and more comfortable. Publishers could publish and advertise their content online and readers could freely browse through thousands of available e-books with a few clicks. However, with this massive growth in digital publishing means a noticeable decline for traditional publishing and printing.</p> <h1 id="digital-publishers-in-e-reading-how-are-they-disruptive">Digital publishers in e-reading: how are they disruptive?</h1> <h2 id="amazon">Amazon</h2> <p><strong>How the Amazon <em>Kindle</em> distinguished itself from competitors</strong></p> <p>Amazon’s <em>Kindle</em> is among the top e-book reading devices and platforms which, despite its design flaws, sold out in under six hours after its release <a class="citation" href="#pierce_kindle_2017">(Pierce, 2017)</a>. One of the main factors behind its success is the Whispernet system, which granted <em>Kindle</em> users 3G connectivity to be able to download books anywhere.</p> <p>It also helped that <em>Kindle</em> leveraged E Ink technology, making the device battery efficient and easy on the eyes. Gradual improvements on the eReading device such as creating more lightweight models with higher resolution text helped maintain Kindle’s purpose as a simple, unintrusive reading device, separating itself from noisy, multipurpose smartphones and computers.</p> <h3 id="other-kindle-features-and-services">Other <em>Kindle</em> features and services</h3> <p>Nevertheless, Amazon employed various strategies to keep its eReader prominent over the years. Most notably, in tandem with the release of the first <em>Kindle</em> model, Amazon launched Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP), a service that allows authors to self-publish e-books, paperbacks, and hardcovers free of charge, with full rights to their books and the option to make them available worldwide <a class="citation" href="#amazon_staff_start_2024">(Amazon Staff, 2024)</a>.</p> <p>Even already published books can be published via KDP, but e-books enrolled in KDP Select become Amazon exclusives and can’t be sold through other platforms. Some content types that can be published via KDP include novels, book series, children’s books, comics, cookbooks, journals, poetry, and textbooks.</p> <p>Amazon added many other quality of life features and subscription services in its first decade, including but not limited to:</p> <ul> <li>A read-to-me feature;</li> <li>A free <em>Kindle</em> app on PC, Mac, IOS, &amp; Android;</li> <li>Whispersync technology which saves reading progress across devices;</li> <li>Kindle Owners’ Lending Library (for Amazon Prime members);</li> <li>Built-in Goodreads community into <em>Kindle</em> (for discovering and discussing books);</li> <li>Kindle First (Early Access to new books); and,</li> <li>Kindle Unlimited (unrestricted access to Kindle books and Audible audiobooks) <a class="citation" href="#amazon_staff_look_2018">(Amazon Staff, 2018)</a>.</li> </ul> <h3 id="where-amazon-kindle-is-at-today">Where Amazon <em>Kindle</em> is at today</h3> <p>Today, Amazon’s <em>Kindle</em> Store lists millions of e-book titles, a far cry from its initial catalog of 90,000 e-books <a class="citation" href="#pierce_kindle_2017">(Pierce, 2017)</a>. It surpassed competitors such as Barnes &amp; Nobles, making up 80% of e-book sales in the US. But e-books are unlikely to replace print, as a Pew Research Center study found that 65% out of 73% US adult readers still read print books <a class="citation" href="#perrin_book_2016">(Perrin, 2016)</a>.</p> <p>However, this same study also found that adults were more likely to read on tablets, phones, and computers. Thus, Amazon continues its efforts in adapting to people’s reading and digital habits, whether it be through combining their Audible e-books with <em>Kindle</em> and enhancing Alexa’s voice for better long-form book listening.</p> <h2 id="wattpad">Wattpad</h2> <p><strong>From page to screen: the Wattpad story</strong></p> <p>Made in 2006 in Canada, Wattpad is an online social reading platform encouraging users to create and share their own stories, whichever genre they choose, from teen fiction to poetry, action, adventure, and a whole lot more.</p> <p>Wattpad aims to break down barriers between readers and writers. Having no restrictions of having stories from those in the public domain to those developed by local users who may now go on and publish for wider audiences <a class="citation" href="#team_what_2022">(Internet Matters Team, 2022)</a>.</p> <h3 id="how-it-changes-the-game-of-publishing">How it changes the game of publishing</h3> <p>Therefore, this continuous rise of self-publishing and the increasing influence of digital platforms have tremendously changed the game of traditional publishing to a more accessible and open space for not only the writers but also the readers as well.</p> <p>Now, you no longer have to go to a library and seek books to read but rather just have your mobile phone or gadget and you can read it without the hassle of bringing a book to wherever you want to go. Moreover, Wattpad offers a way of communication to connect the author and the readers, allowing them to discuss, interact, and build a relationship freely rather than only meeting their favorite authors in a meet and greet event and that’s it.</p> <p>Additionally, another scenario is that readers have transitioned into authors themselves, creating and sharing their own stories and having this huge community of literature lovers all gathered together by just one platform. Wattpad made the concept of authorship more democratic and traditional publishers are no longer the sole gatekeepers of culture and creativity <a class="citation" href="#doi:10.1177/1354856516654459">(Bold, 2018)</a>.</p> <h3 id="where-readers-shape-stories">Where readers shape stories</h3> <p>With this in mind, Wattpad brings together both the readers and the authors to collaborate. It has opened up new opportunities for authors to overthrow the traditional publishing process and gain recognition from the readers through their feedback and social interactions <a class="citation" href="#doi:10.1177/1354856516654459">(Bold, 2018)</a>.</p> <p>It is now turned into a tight-knit circle wherein readers are allowed to vote and the authors are their voices. Wattpad allows stories to grow organically and progressively as the readers have a say and are allowed to comment on their favorite stories to help the authors refine their work.</p> <h3 id="wattpads-winning-formula">Wattpad’s winning formula</h3> <p>But is this strategy and approach of Wattpad of having an author and reader relationship even new in today’s digital age? Well, it is not because Wattpad along with other social media companies have something in common which is a new strategy, applying social media marketing.</p> <p>As we’re currently experiencing, this marketing strategy is an essential tool for businesses and individuals to connect with the audience, build brand awareness, and drive sales <a class="citation" href="#menaka_social_2019">(Menaka &amp; Malarvizhi, 2019)</a> . For instance, the most notable social media site that started this is Facebook.</p> <p>The initial goal of this company was to connect people from different locations and times and build a community despite the geographical hurdles that we face in person. Facebook was built upon the desire to reconnect to people that we meet in this lifetime but also having a platform to voice out anybody’s opinion.</p> <p>Thus, by adding the business side to these technological companies such as social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, brands can now engage directly with consumers, share content, and advertise products or services <a class="citation" href="#menaka_social_2019">(Menaka &amp; Malarvizhi, 2019)</a> . Social media allows targeted advertising that can reach specific demographics and markets based on their user profile including their behavior, location, and interest.</p> <p>Same with how Wattpad is doing, they get to know you when you sign up and show you books, articles, and other literature that you might be interested in. Slowly encouraging you to join and be hooked on potential authors and stories on the platform.</p> <h2 id="webtoon">Webtoon</h2> <p>Webtoon also represents how digital platforms have disrupted traditional publishing, particularly in the comic and graphic novel industry. This was launched in South Korea in 2004 and gained fame after its American and European debut in 2019, now boasting over 170 million active monthly users from more than 150 countries worldwide <a class="citation" href="#harnett2020webtoon">(Harnett &amp; Fusai, 2020; Webtoon Entertainment Inc., no date)</a>.</p> <h3 id="comic-writing-beyond-industry-limits">Comic-writing beyond industry limits</h3> <p>This platform allows independent artists to publish their work without traditional gatekeepers, leading to a more diverse array of stories. The vertical scrolling format optimized for smartphones enhances accessibility, attracting a younger audience that is also digital or tech-savvy.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/digipub2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/digipub2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/digipub2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/digipub2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/digipub3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/digipub3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/digipub3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/digipub3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/digipub4-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/digipub4-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/digipub4-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/digipub4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption" style="font-size:.675rem"> Photos from left to right: <i>Lore Olympus</i> by Rachel Smythe, <i>True Beauty</i> (여신강림) by Yaongyi, <i>Tower of God</i> (신의 탑) by S.I.U.. </div> <p>The success of Webtoon series like “Lore Olympus,” “True Beauty,” and “Tower of God” has led to its adaptations into graphic novels, animated series, and even Korean dramas <a class="citation" href="#webtoon2021loreolympus">(Webtoon Entertainment Inc., 2021)</a>.</p> <p>In turn, traditional publishers are slowly responding by adapting to digital trends. For instance, DC Entertainment partnered with GlobalComix to offer titles in a vertical scrolling format. They now aim to modernize the reading experience and appeal to new readers <a class="citation" href="#salkowitz2024dc">(Salkowitz, 2024)</a>.</p> <p>Without a doubt, platforms like Webtoon have transformed comic publishing by empowering creators, diversifying content, and prompting traditional publishers to innovate in response to evolving reader preferences.</p> <h2 id="scribd">Scribd</h2> <p><strong>Have you ever heard of <em>Scribd</em>? I think you have!</strong></p> <p>Scribd Inc. is a recognized company with large platforms for e-books, audiobooks, podcasts, documents, and even presentations—Everand, Scribd, and SlideShare <a class="citation" href="#Scribd2023">(Scribd, 2023)</a>.</p> <p>Everand is a well-known e-book platform that is especially popular among book enthusiasts and the reader community. It challenges traditional reading by offering an immersive experience that combines e-books and audiobooks. You can also read magazines and newspapers or even listen to podcasts. It promises to deliver unlimited content to its users .</p> <p>While Everand focuses on e-books and audiobooks, Scribd is renowned for its diverse collection of documents, including academic papers. One of Scribd’s most prominent features is its large reach of audiences.</p> <p>Aside from readers and listeners, its domination in academia has also been successfully established. Students, professionals, and educators can easily browse through different research studies, jumping from one paper to the other, may it be scientific or literary <a class="citation" href="#Harriet2023">(Harriet, 2023)</a>.</p> <p>While all of these features look promising, a monthly subscription is required to access them. If payment is required, what is the reason behind Scribd’s triumph in the eReading field?</p> <h3 id="scribd-as-a-threat-to-traditional-publishing">Scribd as a threat to traditional publishing</h3> <p>Today, the preeminence of technology is undeniable. Convenience and accessibility have convinced people to shift toward the emergence of services that can offer variety and flexibility. Scribd has taken over the eReading field successfully because of its ability to deliver an unlimited range of content, varying primarily from e-books, documents, and audio to an expansive global reach.</p> <p>For readers, it is also changing the way they read by having the option of an “autopilot reading” with audiobooks. People can now listen than read books without focusing only on one thing <a class="citation" href="#williams_why_2021">(Williams, 2021)</a>.</p> <p>From an article, <em>Why Scribd’s Business Model Is so Successful?</em> <a class="citation" href="#vizologi_scribd_nodate">(vizologi, n.d.)</a>, in platforms such as Scribd, many authors and writers are given more opportunities with its self-publishing feature, effortlessly reaching thousands of readers. Unlike traditional publishing, subscribers can now have access to diverse materials with one swipe of a card, which is a detrimental disadvantage of individually published books with their individual purchases.</p> <p>Scribd remains one of the leading e-book publishing platforms today. Over the past few years, its popularity has steadily grown as more people shift to online reading and publishing, catering to a wide range of needs—whether for avid reading, casual enjoyment, or academic and research purposes. This transition marks both a significant leap forward and a step back for traditional publishing​.</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <p><span id="amazon_staff_look_2018">Amazon Staff. (2018).
