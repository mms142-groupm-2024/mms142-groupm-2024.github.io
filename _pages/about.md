Publishing has had a long and colored history, dating back to even before the advent of the printing press. 

This site was made as a report on the [history](https://mms142-groupm-2024.github.io/history/), its ins and outs, and [how the Internet affected](https://mms142-groupm-2024.github.io/digital/) and [continues to affect](https://mms142-groupm-2024.github.io/state/) it.
