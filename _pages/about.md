Publishing has had a long and colored history, dating back to even before the advent of the printing press. 

This site was made as a report on that `history`, its ins and outs, and `how the Intenet affected` and `continues to affect` it.

This site was made as a requirement in the completion of the course Internet Technologies and Web Development (MMS142) for the University of the Philippines Open University.

It is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) with the [al-folio theme](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), which was then customized by [members of Group M](https://mms142-groupm-2024.github.io/people/).
