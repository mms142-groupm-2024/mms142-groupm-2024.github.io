Neighboring countries such as Japan and Korea were also utilizing woodblock printing during that time. Metal block printing was also eventually developed.</p> <p>A century later, a moveable type was developed by Bi Sheng from Yingshan, Hubei, China.</p> <p>The moveable type was initially carved into clay and baked into hard blocks that would allow individual characters to be rearranged and reused. By 1127 to 1279 AD, during the time of the Southern Song Dynasty, books had become a vital part of society as it helped educate the population, creating a scholarly class who became civil servants. Book collections had also become a status symbol for the wealthy.</p> <p>In 1297, a Ching-te magistrate Wang Chen printed Nung Shu, a treatise on agriculture and farming practices using woodtype, heralding the comeback of this printing process. Nung Shu was exported to Europe and was considered the world’s first mass-produced book <a class="citation" href="#printingpress">(History.com, 2018)</a>.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/press_1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/press_1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/press_1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/press_1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/press_2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/press_2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/press_2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/press_2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/books_1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/books_1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/books_1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/books_1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="example image" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption" style="font-size:.675rem"> Photos from Unsplash (from left to right) by <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/black-and-brown-case-n2ILm0aTCYo" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hannes Wolf</a>, <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/assorted-wood-stamps-OhJmwB4XWLE" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bruno Martins</a>, and <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/assorted-title-books-Gs-tdnDyYKE" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Stephen Phillips</a>. </div> <p>In the 15th century, traditional publishing underwent a significant change due to the invention of Johannes Gutenberg being introduced: movable-type printing.</p> <p>This made it possible to produce books more efficiently and at a lower cost compared to hand-copied manuscripts, which had previously been the norm. Furthermore, not only did the printing press facilitate the mass production of books but also revolutionized communication by enabling the rapid spread of information.</p> <p>It played a crucial role during the Renaissance by fostering the spread of humanist ideas, as well as during the Reformation— by sharing Martin Luther’s works concerning his criticism of the Catholic Church. This democratized knowledge, allowing people from different social backgrounds to engage with ideas that had previously been accessible only to the elite <a class="citation" href="#roos2023">(Roos, 2023)</a>.</p> <p>By the 19th century, traditional publishing had developed into a centralized industry led by major publishing houses that curated literature, shaped cultural narratives, and controlled access to the market. These institutions played an important role in determining which voices, dreams, ideas, and perspectives were heard.</p> <p>Industrial advancements (like mechanized printing and the use of woodcut illustrations) further improved production and enhanced the visual appeal of publications, contributing to the growing popularity of printed materials. This in turn also allowed publishers to cater to growing demands <a class="citation" href="#tuckeretal2024">(Tucker et al., 2024)</a>.</p> <h2 id="the-publishing-process">The Publishing Process</h2> <p>Over time, publishing became more structured — with publishers selecting works to produce based on their potential appeal to the public. As physical books gained popularity, marketing strategies—like newspaper advertisements—also helped connect readers to new works, laying down the foundation for the commercial publishing industry <a class="citation" href="#journalismuniversity2024">(Journalism University, 2024)</a>.</p> <h2 id="challenges-of-the-traditional-model">Challenges of the Traditional Model</h2> <p>Despite its historical significance, traditional publishing faced several challenges through the years:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Cost and Efficiency: High printing and distribution costs and lengthy production timelines. These hindered publishers to respond quickly to shift and adapt to market demands (missing reference).</p> </li> <li> <p>Limited Inclusivity: The centralized structure of publishing houses imposed rigorous selection criteria, often excluding voices that deviated from trends or lacked representation. This exclusivity reinforced a gatekeeping system prioritizing established authors over emerging ones <a class="citation" href="#tuckeretal2024">(Tucker et al., 2024)</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dependence on Physical Formats: Reliance on physical books made the industry vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences, such as the growing demand for digital formats <a class="citation" href="#roos2023">(Roos, 2023)</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="precursor-to-disruption">Precursor to Disruption</h2> <p>With the start of the era of digital technology, the inefficiencies of traditional publishing have become increasingly evident. Platforms like Amazon Kindle and Wattpad offered faster, more affordable, and inclusive alternatives, bypassing traditional gatekeeping structures.</p> <p>Self-publishing options empowered authors and enabled them to reach global audiences instantly. The emergence of e-books and online marketing tools marked the beginning of a fundamental change that still challenges traditional publishing today <a class="citation" href="#journalismuniversity2024">(Journalism University, 2024)</a>.</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <p><span id="journalismuniversity2024">Journalism University.
